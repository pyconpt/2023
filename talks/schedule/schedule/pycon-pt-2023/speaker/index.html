Roitman's success began at age 11, when he created his first viral video game, and it continued later on when he created and sold his first augmented reality software to a multinational company, becoming one of the youngest self-made millionaires in the world. Besides becoming a three-time Olympic medalist in informatics and represented the nation twice internationally, in Italy and Thailand, for the IOI competitions, he also became an international Olympic medalist in the Ibero-American olympiads.<br>
After receiving several scholarships from prestigious institutions such as MIT, Yale, and Stanford in the United States, he chose to join Stanford University in California, where he graduated with honors. While studying there, he was selected to participate in programs at Berlin and Peking University. After creating the start-up Lighthouse, an advanced technology camera for home security that was eventually sold to Apple, Roitman began to develop his own smart drone company called Adia Robotics, and he is currently working on various confidential projects within Apple, as well as creating a startup to enable Artificial Intelligence to run on the blockchain. Lucas Roitman is still a part of the Research Department at Stanford University, where he periodically publishes papers on Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, science, and technology, as well as business and entrepreneurship.</p></div>

<p>I created Esmerald, Saffier, Asyncz, Django Tenants URL, Django Messages DRF and a bunch of other opensource tools being widely used by a lot of companies and people.</p>
<p>I do a lot of Open Source projects and code to give back to the community what I've learnt and that demands even more time than the one I currently have and all my free time goes to the free and open-source software I build.</p>
<p>By checking my public repositories you will see that I've done a lot of the heavy lifting for a lot of frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Angular, React, React for Blockchain...) that will save a lot of time and configurations, it will save months to be very honest to a lot of developers (structure, configurations...), I hope you enjoy using them as I do enjoy maintaining them</p></div>
