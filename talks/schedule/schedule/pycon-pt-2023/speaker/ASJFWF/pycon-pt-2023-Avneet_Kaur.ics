DESCRIPTION:Data science projects are often characterized by visualizations
  which \nenhances the creative storytelling process and allow us to derive
  actionable \ninsights from data. This is enabled through the use of good 
 visualization tools/libraries which enable us to present data in a manner 
 that is interactive and is easily understandable. Often\, the action in it
 self tends to be more significantly remembered by the audience in comparis
 on to static insights. This inturn \ncalls for the need for using interact
 ive dashboards as a way to present the data.  \nCurrently\, the plethora o
 f tools available for this purpose often makes it a tedious task to decide
  which is the best fit. Often the choice oscillates between learning to us
 e explicit dashboarding tools or using existing python libraries which may
  allow visualizations but not necessarily dashboarding. \nApart from the c
 ost associated with some of these explicit dashboarding tools\, there migh
 t also be a learning curve associated with it.  \nTherefore\, in this talk
 \, I would like to take you through a simple pythonic approach of building
  dainty dashboards using Plotly Dash in python to ease the process of data
  exploration and allow for interactive visualizations that enable creative
  storytelling.
