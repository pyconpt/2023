        <meta name="description" content="Everyone is happy with what Python 3.11 and the future 3.12 is bringing to the Python ecosystem, but in case you haven&#x27;t heard already of the improvements, most of them were made at the core of CPython to affect the interpreter.

It is very probable that many people out there, have ideas that can help Python to be better, but for that, you would need to dive into the CPython code at some point, and possibly perform modifications in C.

A subset of the API is indeed written in Python, but most of the other crucial core components are written in C - and with that, many people might not know C so well.
The main building block of the internals, the PyObject, is a particular C-structure with many details and components that are worth studying, similarly, basic functions Python programmers use intensively like the print function, lists, dictionaries, etc - have C at their core.

The main objective of this talk is to motivate people to start being involved in low-level languages that make Python better, mainly not being afraid into picking up a bit of C knowledge to continue improving the core of CPython, and the many solutions out there that allow you to optimize the code, bindings, and why not, the creation of the &#x27;next&#x27; blazing fast and performant module that will improve many peoples lives.

After this talk, you will be able to modify Python&#x27;s functionality from its core, add new API, create your new C-based Python modules, and more.
Some ideas of C would be good, but not necessary.

Outline:
- Highlights of new things in 3.11 and 3.12
- How Python works internally?
+ CPython introduction and repo overview
+ PyObject description
+ Explain how data types works (lists, sets, ...)
- Super brief introduction to the most important features of C to understand CPython
- Creating a C-based extension for Python
- Modifications to the common python functionality.">
