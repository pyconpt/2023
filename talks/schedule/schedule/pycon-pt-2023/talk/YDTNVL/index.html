        <meta name="description" content="One of the main premises when writing production-ready code is to make it as reliable as possible, therefore we can implement new features, refactor and make changes to our code with confidence. One tool that helps us achieve this goal is testing. 

What is the first thing that comes to mind when talking about testing? Probably the test pyramid: unit, integrations, and E2E tests, and often that is enough when implementing tests in our codebase. But, what if you could boost all of them with little effort and make your codebase even more reliable?
It&#x27;s almost impossible to capture all of the edge cases that can occur in our application and reflect those cases as tests. In this workshop, we’ll use the Hypothesis Python testing library to help us generate random data and run multiple test cases with arbitrary inputs in order to increase our trust and coverage in our test suite. So we can break… sorry, refactor our code with confidence :).
After this workshop, you’ll be able to start including property-based tests in your project, and you’ll also be able to identify the main cases where property testing makes sense (Spoiler alert! Not all tests should be implemented with a property-based approach)">

Since 2022, I lead the “Quito Lambda” Meetup community in Ecuador, a space that aims to share topics mainly related to the functional programming paradigm and its usage. I’m eager to share what I’ve learned over these years with a broader software community. During my free time, I enjoy cooking and discovering the world through its flavors.
