        <meta name="description" content="There are great frameworks out there like FastAPI, Flama, Flask, Django... All of them solving majority of the current day-to-day problems of 99% of the applications but leaving the 1% that is usually around structure and design/business without to much to do.

Esmerald got the inspiration from those great frameworks out there and was built with all the known amazing features but with business in mind as well.

Saffier leverages the power of Pydantic for its fields while offering a friendly, familiar and easy to use interface.

This ORM was designed to be flexible and compatible with pretty much every ASGI framework, like Esmerald, Starlette, FastAPI, Sanic, Quart... With simple pluggable design thanks to its origins.

For this 30 minute session it is aimed to showcase:

A robust and organized python application with Esmerald (https://esmerald.dev) and Saffier (https://saffier.tarsild.io) while integrating the native JWT authentication with a clean API design using Esmerald native routing system and leveraging Esmerald native validations using pydantic with python typing system.">

<p>Creator of Esmerald and many other opensource projects.</p>
<p>Web 3.0, Cloud, Data Analytics, Blockchain and all in between are the areas that I can help you.</p>
<p>I created Esmerald, Saffier, Asyncz, Django Tenants URL, Django Messages DRF and a bunch of other opensource tools being widely used by a lot of companies and people.</p>
<p>I do a lot of Open Source projects and code to give back to the community what I've learnt and that demands even more time than the one I currently have and all my free time goes to the free and open-source software I build.</p>
<p>By checking my public repositories you will see that I've done a lot of the heavy lifting for a lot of frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, Angular, React, React for Blockchain...) that will save a lot of time and configurations, it will save months to be very honest to a lot of developers (structure, configurations...), I hope you enjoy using them as I do enjoy maintaining them</p></div>
