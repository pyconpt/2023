        <meta name="description" content="Tavern is an open source pytest plugin aimed to write automated integration tests for HTTP and MQTT APIs. Although based in pytest, the tests are specified in the YAML format, which makes support out-of-the-box in major Python IDEs, such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, not possible. 

Tavern Crawler was developed to address the non-existence of a Tavern UI tool. The tool is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension, with an interface loosely based in VSCode’s Test Explorer, so that developers feel immediately familiar working with it. Having such tool eases writing tests, which can become difficult especially when the number of tests and its complexity increases; and also enables quick visual assessment of the state of these.

This talk will address the following topics:
1. Brief introduction to Tavern
2. Issues with large Tavern projects and why an UI is important
3. Present and explore the Tavern Crawler extension with live examples
4. Lessons learned and the future of Tavern Crawler">
