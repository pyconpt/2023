        <meta name="description" content="Python has some weird interpreter quirks that behave in unexpected ways. In this talk, we will go over a few ways in which Python behaves unexpectedly:

- Introduction: What this talk is about, and why it is important to steer clear of some known &quot;gotchas&quot;
- Meat of the Talk: Going over examples of ways in which Python behaves weirdly:
1. Mutable default arguments: When we provide mutable default arguments, some strange things might happen.
2. Integer Caching: This is how the `is` operator can behave in weird ways, and sometimes it is not between -5 and 256 that the `is` operator works.
3. Late Binding Closures: Python *late-binds* when creating functions within another function.
4. Match/Case Weirdness: Match/Case statements actually assign the variables when binding values to variables.
