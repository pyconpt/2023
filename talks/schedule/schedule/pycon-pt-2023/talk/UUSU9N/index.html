        <meta name="description" content="Until now, dapps have never been able to incorporate machine learning models. Therefore, it is hard for a dapp such as DTube to compete against centralized apps such as YouTube that can offer better content recommendations to their users. 
Now, you can finally upload your machine learning model to the blockchain, to use in dapps, protocols, or cryptocurrencies. This technology will be explained in detail and how anyone can easily deploy a very simple machine learning model to the blockchain.

The talk addresses the challenge of integrating machine learning models into decentralized applications (dapps). This has historically been a barrier, limiting the competitiveness of dapps against their centralized counterparts. The session will provide insights on how to deploy and leverage ML models on the blockchain, thus empowering dapps to deliver more personalized and advanced services. It aims to facilitate the convergence of AI and blockchain for enhanced application development.
The goal is for attendees to leave with a clear understanding of how to deploy machine learning models on blockchain; and to see the potential of blockchain and AI convergence in creating more personalized, secure, and efficient dapps, thus bridging the gap between decentralized and centralized applications. It is also aimed to foster innovation and collaboration in the blockchain space.">

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Lucas Roitman is an entrepreneur and researcher best known for his inventions and research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Augmented Reality. Roitman's success began at age 11, when he created his first viral video game, and it continued later on when he created and sold his first augmented reality software to a multinational company, becoming one of the youngest self-made millionaires in the world. Besides becoming a three-time Olympic medalist in informatics and represented the nation twice internationally, in Italy and Thailand, for the IOI competitions, he also became an international Olympic medalist in the Ibero-American olympiads.<br>
After receiving several scholarships from prestigious institutions such as MIT, Yale, and Stanford in the United States, he chose to join Stanford University in California, where he graduated with honors. While studying there, he was selected to participate in programs at Berlin and Peking University. After creating the start-up Lighthouse, an advanced technology camera for home security that was eventually sold to Apple, Roitman began to develop his own smart drone company called Adia Robotics, and he is currently working on various confidential projects within Apple, as well as creating a startup to enable Artificial Intelligence to run on the blockchain. Lucas Roitman is still a part of the Research Department at Stanford University, where he periodically publishes papers on Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, science, and technology, as well as business and entrepreneurship.</p></div>
