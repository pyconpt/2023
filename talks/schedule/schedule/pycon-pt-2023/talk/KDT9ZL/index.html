        <meta name="title" content="MicroPython and time series analysis: Forecasting and trend analysis  - PyCon Portugal 2023 pretalx">
        <meta name="description" content="The workshop on &quot;MicroPython and time series analysis: Forecasting and trend analysis&quot; is designed to help attendees learn how to perform time series analysis, forecasting, and trend analysis using MicroPython. This workshop is ideal for anyone interested in learning how to analyze data collected over time, and how to use MicroPython to implement these analyses on microcontrollers.

The workshop will begin with an introduction to time series analysis, which is the study of data points collected over time. I will explore the different types of time series data, including univariate and multivariate time series, and the common methods used to analyze this data, such as trend analysis and forecasting.

Next, I will discuss the advantages of using MicroPython for time series analysis on microcontrollers. Attendees will learn how to use MicroPython to read time series data from sensors and how to preprocess this data for analysis. They will also learn how to implement different types of time series analysis, such as trend analysis and forecasting, using MicroPython.

I will then showcase some practical examples of time series analysis,  weather forecasting and demonstrate how to implement these using MicroPython. Attendees will have the opportunity to work on hands-on exercises and build their own time series analysis models using MicroPython.

In the second half of the workshop, I will focus on deploying and running the time series analysis models on microcontrollers. Attendees will learn how to optimize the models for microcontrollers and how to deploy them using MicroPython. I will also discuss the challenges of working with limited computational resources and how to overcome them.

By the end of the workshop, attendees will have gained practical experience in performing time series analysis using MicroPython. They will be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to develop their own time series analysis models using MicroPython and will have a solid understanding of the benefits and limitations of using MicroPython for time series analysis on microcontrollers.

This workshop is suitable for anyone interested in time series analysis, microcontrollers, and MicroPython, from beginners to experienced practitioners. Attendees are expected to have a basic understanding of Python programming and data analysis, but no prior experience with time series analysis or microcontrollers is necessary.">

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Olaniyan Adewale Hafeez is a trained civil engineer but chose IT as a career and built his reputation at home and abroad. He was a computer technician and network administrator at the beginning of his IT career until he switched to programming. He has over ten years of experience with Python &amp; PHP. Adewale has developed various applications in Python for both private and government organizations. He has wide knowledge in HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, Python, Magneto, MySQL, Twitter, Bootstraps, Scratch, Codeigniter, Python, Flask, Django Framework, Vuejs, Dart and Flutter. He is a Full-Stack Developer, Data Scientist, and Embedded Engineer.<br>
He has trained thousands of students in the Open Source field. He spent most of his time promoting Open Source technologies. He has organized free Open-Source Seminars for different organizations and communities like the Nigeria Computer Society of Nigeria, Universities and the like.<br>
He is the founder of Couone Technology Limited, an IT consultancy firm. He also founded TechWorld Academy, Nigeriware Enterprise and Techware Innovation Bahrain. He teaches kids aged 8 to 16 robotics, cartooning and animation.<br>
Currently, he is a full entrepreneur under the Technical Incubation Centre of the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology. He also provides consultancy to Ogun TechHub under his company Couone Technology Limited. Additionally, he runs another innovation called RobotKkraft Africa, which provides embedded systems, IoT and robotics bootcamps for youth, graduates, and professionals.<br>
Besides these, he uses his spare time to develop embedded devices. This has become one of his passions and hobbies by making use of Arduino, esp8266 and other Internet of Things boards.<br>
