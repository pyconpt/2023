        <meta name="description" content="Given the recent boom of AI code assistants, more and more programmers are starting to use them to increase their day-to-day performance and delegate some routine tasks. But how to choose a suitable and robust helper? Is this possible at the moment?

During this talk, we are going to compare 3 AI code assistants for Python: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Amazon CodeWhisperer. 
The criteria will be as follows:
- **security**: how passwords &amp; SQL queries are being handled
- **code readability**: is generated code easy to follow?
- **cut-off date**: what is the latest knowledge of assistant (Python version, packages awareness)
- **creativity**: given a certain code, how good is the assistant at creating a Streamlit app?
- **code testing**: the ability to generate unit tests to code for different scenarios
- **debugging/troubleshooting**: the ability to find an error or to handle it

In addition to comparison, the results of the programmers&#x27; AI code assistants usage survey will be shared. By the end of this talk, attendants will have a good understanding of the differences between AI code assistants for Python, and they will be aware of the possible advantages/disadvantages of each mentioned assistant.">
