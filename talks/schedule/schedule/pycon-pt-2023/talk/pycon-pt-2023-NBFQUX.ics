DESCRIPTION:In Artificial Intelligence systems\, a renaissance has unfolded
  in recent years\, captivating the imagination of many! However\, a startl
 ing statistic emerges amidst the enthusiasm: merely 13% of machine learnin
 g models are deployed into production!\n\nIndeed\, the artistry of buildin
 g and deploying these systems supersedes mere scientific methodology as th
 ese models dwell within the realm of complexity and are characterized by a
 n inherent reliance on data distribution. Have you ever wondered if these 
 models are trained upon biased data they are destined to produce haywire d
 ecisions?\n\nIn this talk\, let us delve into the realm of ethicality\, fa
 irness\, and unbiasedness\, culminating in the seamless integration of mac
 hine learning models that embrace ethical considerations in their journey 
 towards production using Python!
