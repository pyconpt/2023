Python&#x27;s &quot;speed problem&quot; is not a new issue, but there are different ways to speed a Python program up. In recent years, Python 3.11 was released and popularized as the [&quot;faster Python&quot;](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#summary-release-highlights) and [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo) programming language was recently announced, advertised as having &quot;usability of Python with the performance of C&quot;. Going back further, we see languages such as Cython, Just In Time (JIT) compilers and bindings.
