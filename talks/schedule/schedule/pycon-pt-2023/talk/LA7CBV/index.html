        <meta name="description" content="Flask is a popular and flexible web framework for Python, but building scalable and maintainable Flask applications can be challenging without a solid understanding of architecture patterns. 
This workshop aims to provide participants with a detailed explanation of applying architecture patterns to Flask projects. By exploring various design principles and best practices, attendees will learn how to structure their Flask applications for improved scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

Focusing on the Repository, Unit of Work, and Use Cases patterns, attendees will gain experience in applying these patterns to enhance code organization, maintainability, and testability. All these layers are wired together using Dependency Injection, which is yet another powerful tool to use in your applications.

The application we are going to build is stored in: https://github.com/ShahriyarR/hexagonal-flask-blog-tutorial 

We are going to completely rewrite the official Blog application described in [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/tutorial/blog/) by applying architecture patterns.

All abstraction layers are covered by unit and integration tests, which will give the attendees a detailed view of why it is important to structure the application using architecture patterns.">
