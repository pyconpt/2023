The easiest way to travel is with the Municipal Urban Transport Services of Coimbra (SMTUC), which ensures the arrival at any point of the city. It works from 6:00 to 00:00, with short and regular periods. 
1 day ticket – 3,70€.

Since Coimbra is a small town, it’s easy to walk through, despite its hills. In only one hour, you can cross almost the whole town on foot, from one end to other. But it’s not easy to circle by bike, due to its topography.

Taxis are the most expensive public transportation in the city but are a good alternative in the hours buses don’t operate. You can also use ride-sharing apps such as Uber, Bolt and Free Now.
