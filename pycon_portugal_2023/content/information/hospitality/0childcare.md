### Details coming soon...

[//]: # (Childcare at PyCon Portugal and tech conferences more generally is an important factor that helps folks attend who otherwise may not be able to. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to PyCon Portugal and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.)

[//]: # (If you are interested in childcare free of charge please talk to us on email: [2023@pycon.pt]&#40;mailto:2023@pycon.pt&#41;. You can apply until August 31st.)
