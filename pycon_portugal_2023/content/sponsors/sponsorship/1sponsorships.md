This 2nd edition of PyCon Portugal will be taking place from Coimbra and will be accessible worldwide. 


PyCon Portugal is a conference run **by** the Python community **for** the Python community, and we believe this is the best conference for partners and sponsors to connect **with** the Python community and to be part of it. PyCon Portugal is very professionally run, 100% by passionate volunteers and on a not-for-profit basis.
